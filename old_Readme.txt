Here you can see how to compile and execute different test executable we created during the development process to see the funcionality of our implementation:

	1.Test inner product ammortized encryption
		Build by issuing: make ipdb-m-driver
it uses the class Ipdb in ipdb-m where we have the definition of the basic algorithms, developed through ipe-m, the basic inner product encryption implementation;

	2.Test inner product ammortized encryption with noise
		Build by issuing: make ipdbnoise-m-driver
it uses the class IpdbNoise in ipdb-m where we have the definition of the basic algorithms, developed through ipe-m, the basic inner product encryption implementation;
